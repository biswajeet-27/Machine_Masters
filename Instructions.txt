1. Download the dataset & extract it into your system.
2. Inside the extracted folder, find a csv file named "HAM10000_metadata.csv".
3. Note the "HAM10000_metadata.csv" file path & Set it on the "df=pd.read_csv(<dataset_path>)".
4. Next update the "base_skin_dir = " to the extracted folder path.
5. Now you are ready to run the code.

N.B.: The code might take couple of hours to run depending upon your system configuration.


Brief description of the dataset:
1. Number of classes: 07
2. Class names: Melanocytic nevi , Melanoma, Benign keratosis-like lesions, Basal cell carcinoma, Actinic keratoses, Vascular lesions, Dermatofibroma


Breif Description of the code: 
1. Loading the metadata: Using the OS module we have mapped the corresponding images to the metadata.
2. Data Pre-Processing - This includes creating features, lables, spliting dataset into training & testing, Normalizing/Standardizing the images, and OneHot encoding the labels.
3. Building a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
4. Making predictions using the built model.
5. Evaluating the model
